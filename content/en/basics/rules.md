1. One should wash hands, feet, and face before practicing asanas.  
2. Men and women must wear properly fitting undergarments during practice.  

3. Asanas should not be practiced on a full stomach; only after 2.5 to 3 hours following a meal.  

4. There should be no incense smoke or any kind of smoke in the practice room.  

5. Asanas should be practiced indoors, in a place without drafts, but with windows open for ventilation.  

6. Asanas should be practiced on a blanket or mat.  

7. Breathe through the nose during asana practice (breath should pass through the left nostril or both nostrils).  

8. A vegetarian diet is highly recommended.  

9. After practicing asanas, massage the entire body (from head to toe, especially the joints) – this is very beneficial.  

10. After massaging, lie down in Savasana (corpse pose) for relaxation (minimum 2 minutes, maximum 10 minutes).  

11. Taking a walk after completing Savasana is very good.  

12. Wait about 10 minutes after Savasana before coming into contact with water.  

13. Wait about 10–15 minutes after Savasana before consuming liquid food, and 30 minutes before eating solid food.  

14. Physical exercise or other sports are encouraged, but should not be done immediately after asana practice.  

15. If you are ill (e.g., with a cold or flu), do not practice asanas.  

16. Women should not practice asanas during menstruation, pregnancy, or within one month after childbirth.
